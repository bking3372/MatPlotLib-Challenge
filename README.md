# The Power of Plots

### Background: A study was conducted with 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth.  In the 45 day study, the mice were treated with a variety of drug regimens and tumor development was measured at regular intervals.

**Objective:**  Generate tables and figures needed for a technical analysis of this study, including the following:
*  Summary statistics by drug group including the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and mean standard error of tumor volumes for each drug
*  A bar plot of the number of mice treated across all time points for each drug regimen
*  A pie plot of the distribution of mice gender
*  An analysis of the final tumor volume for 4 drug regimens including quartiles, outliers, and box plots
*  A scatter plot of weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen along with the correlation of the two variables and  linear regression equation (including the R-squared value)

### Data Observations:

1. Average tumor volumes range from a low of 40.2 (Ramicane drug regimen) to a high of 55.2 (Ketapril drug regimen).

2. There is an equal distribution of male and female mice in the study.


3. There is a strong, positive correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen.
