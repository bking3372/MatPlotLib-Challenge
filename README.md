HW5 MatPlotLib Challenge:  The Power of Plots

Background: A study was conducted with 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth.  In the 45 day study, the mice were treated with a variety of drug regimens and tumor development was measured at regular intervals.

Objective:  Generate the tables and figures needed for a technical report of the study.  The requested data includes the following:
*  Summary statistics by drug group:  mean, median, variance, standard deviation, mean standard error of tumor volumes for each drug
*  Bar plot of number of mice treated across time points for each drug regimen
*  Pie plot of the distribution of mice gender
*  An analysis of the final tumor volume for 4 drug regimens including quartiles, outliers and box plots
*  Scatter plot of weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen along with the correlation of the two variables and  linear regression equation (including the R-squared value)
